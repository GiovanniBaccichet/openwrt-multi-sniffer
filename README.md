<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Introduction

The goal of this project is use off-the-shelves hardware, paired with the open source router Operating System (OS) OpenWrt, to perform **WiFi Probe Request frame sniffing over multiple channels**, more specifically in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum.
Acquired data is then saved to a remote shared folder using SMB and **Tailscale** to access the cloud in a safe and reliable way.

## Setup Overview

Our setup consisted in a `Linksys MR8300 v1.1`, running `OpenWrt 22.03.2`. The Linksys MR8300 is a MU-MIMO Tri-Band WiFi router, which has one 2.4GHz and two 5GHz WiFi Interfaces. We chose it for the generous amount of RAM (`512 MB`) and ROM (`256 MB` of NAND) present in the system, the powerful CPU (`Qualcomm IPQ4019`), as well as the great community support.

Additionally it has four 1 Gbps LAN ports, one 1 Gbps WAN port, an USB 3.0 interface and four external antennas. The device is equipped with a Bluetooth chip. With all that said, it is a good fit for a lot of similar projects and applications.

The [Table of Hardware](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/mr8300#hardware) offered by the OpenWrt wiki gives us interesting insights on the hardware that powers this router.

We are interested in the Network Interface Cards (NICs) and their capabilities.

> The first 5 GHz radio (`IPQ4019`) is limited to ch. 64 and below. The second 5 GHz radio (`QCA9888`), is limited to ch. 100 and above. This is consistent with OEM firmware and is a result of the ART data and the data in the OEM firmware's cal data. This is perhaps due to RF design optimization and/or interoperation with 2.4 GHz, such as the two, shared antennas.

Considering that, with a little bit of research we can find the software interface arrangement:
- `radio0` ‚Üí 5 GHz upper wireless phy interface
- `radio1` ‚Üí	2.4 GHz wireless phy interface
- `radio2` ‚Üí	5 GHz lower wireless phy interface

Both chipsets are monitor-mode capable.

## Installation

The script uses the Scapy Python library to sniff WiFi Probe Requests and then save them as `.pcap` Network Packet Captures.

In order to install the required software, you can use the following command, accessing the router via SSH:

```bash
opkg update opkg install iw tcpdump tailscale kmod-fs-cifs kmod-nls-base jq
```

The list of known MAC address vendors can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/raw/master/manuf).
